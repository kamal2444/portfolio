      <p>Hello! My name is kamal, a passionate frontend developer with a solid
        foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am currently expanding my skills in React.js,
        which I have been diligently learning for the past 10 months at Horizon Academy. At 20 years old,
        I am a dedicated 2nd-year BCA student at DAV College Abohar. My journey
        in web development is fueled by my enthusiasm for creating dynamic and user-friendly
        interfaces. Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
